# MY JAVA RESPOSITORY
## MyMidtermLabExam - IT Ticket Processing System

This project simulates a basic IT ticket management system. It includes activities such as creating tickets, viewing ticket details, updating status, and searching tickets.

### Activities Breakdown

- **Ticket Creation (`CreateTicketActivity`)**
  - Allows users to submit new IT support tickets.
  - Users input information such as issue description, priority, and contact details.
  - The activity validates input fields and saves the ticket to the database or data structure.

- **Ticket Listing (`TicketListActivity`)**
  - Displays a list of all submitted tickets.
  - Supports filtering by status, priority, or date.
  - Implements RecyclerView or ListView to handle dynamic data rendering.

- **Ticket Details (`TicketDetailsActivity`)**
  - Shows detailed information of a selected ticket.
  - Provides options to update status or add comments.
  - Implements data binding to display ticket data.

- **Update Ticket Status (`UpdateStatusActivity`)**
  - Enables updating the status of a ticket (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved).
  - Handles data validation and persistence.

Key Concepts & Implementation Details

- Use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to model tickets and users.
- Data storage can be handled via SQLite database, SharedPreferences, or in-memory data structures.
- Implements basic CRUD operations.
- User interface designed with XML layouts, focusing on usability.
